## 1. Background reading 

- I am using Alison Presmanes Hill (co-author of the book)'s tutorial https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/#in-github. 
- Amber Thomas http://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/ 
- Danielle Navarro's post: you can delete bravely. https://djnavarro.net/post/2018-04-27-starting-blogdown/





## 2. My set up 

MacOS, R (version) and RStudio (version?), GitHub 



A few ways to deploy, I choose Netlify and free subdomain *.rbind.io.
