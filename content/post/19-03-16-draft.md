As a PhD student, doing statistical advising to clinicians at our university hospital is sometimes part of the job, I also enjoy doing it (when I have time) because it allows me to see real problems and real data. It is also a very good way to learn how to interpret the model results. I intend to blog about the little pieces of basic statistics that I encounter, just to refresh my momery and to understand the modern world and its complexity a bit better.

### Short version 

1. when calculating probability, use the logistic function with $X \beta$ as input. Don't forget the constant $\beta_0$. 
2. when interpreting individual coefficients $\beta$, you are dealing with logarithms. Remember to take exponent! 
3. always specify your baseline (reference group).  
4. distinguish odds, log odds (logit), odds ratio, log odds ratio. Your response is the log odds (of success), and individual regression coefficient is the log odds ratio between categories.

### Reminder on odds, odds ratio and probability 

The reason for struggles when interpreting logistic regression is usally the confusion between the following concepts - they are not difficult themselves, but when put together with a regression problem it might be not straightforward. 

Probability: $p$ 

Odds: $\frac{p}{1-p}$

Log odds (logit)

  $$\alpha = logit(p) = log \frac{p}{1-p}$$

Therefore the probability 

$$p = logistic(\alpha) = logit^{-1}(\alpha) = \frac{exp(\alpha)}{1+exp(\alpha)}$$

Odds ratio: ratio of 2 odds, 

$$R = \frac{odds1}{odds2} = \frac{p_1/(1-p_1)}{p_2/(1-p_2)}= logit(p_1) - logit(p_2) $$

### A very simple logistic regression example 

To get started, I want to write about logistic regression, and more specifically the interpretation of the interaction term. I will limit my scope to 2 binary predictors $X_1$ and $X_2$. For better intuition, let's assign the predictors to fictional but realistic variables. We wish to find out whether **being a cat owner** is associated with the **location** and **sex**. 

- $X_1$ is the city (city A = 0, city B = 1)
- $X_2$ is the sex (female = 0, male = 1)
- $Y$ is whether the subject is a cat owner (cat owner = 1, no cat = 0)

Fitted model: 

$$logit(P(Y = 1)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 city + \beta_2 sex + \beta_3city*sex$$

I sometimes wonder why it is not **logit** regression. 



Note on the left-hand-side 

$$logit(P(Y = 1)) = log \frac{P(Y = 1)}{P(Y = 0)}$$,

 the logarithm of an event happening (owning cat) compared to not happening (not owning cat). In order to understand what each $\beta​$ indicates, it is better to find scenarios where we are only left with one of them. 
 
<br/>
#### Scenario 1: city A, female (baseline)

In this case both variables take values 0, and the equation becomes 

$$logit(P(Y = 1)) = \beta_0$$ 

Therefore $P(Y = 1) = logistic(\beta_0) = \frac{exp(\beta_0)}{1+exp(\beta_0)}​$, being the probability of owning a cat if one is a female living in city A. 

#### Scenario 2: city B, female (main effect)

In this case variable $city = 1$, leading 

$$logit(P(Y = 1)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$

At this point we can also calculate the probability of owning a cat being a famale living in city B, by plugging in $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ into the logistic function. 

Similarly, to find out the case being a male living in city A, you just need to set $city = 0, sex = 1$ and that will leave you 

$$logit(P(Y = 1)) = \beta_0 + \beta_2​$$

#### Scenario 3: city B, male (interaction)

Here is when we set $city = 1, sex = 1$ and on the right-hand-side of the equation we will have $\beta_0+ \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$.

### On regression coefficient

If we could still easily understand what $\beta_0$, the constant represents (the log odds of event happening at baseline), the others would require some careful examination. I think 2 things could be tricky: 

1. The logarithm on the left (logit), therefore we need to remember the exponential function when we interpret the odds.
2. Odds vs odds ratio.
   - **Odds** refers to the outcome (happening vs not happening)
   - **Odds ratio** (OR) refers to the outcome (happening vs not happening) in 2 different scenarios. Therefore when we interpret individual coefficients, we always need to specify what are the 2 scenarios. 
   - OR is a ratio, but due to the log-odds we could use subtraction instead of division. This comes handy in interpreting the individual coefficient. 

For instance, $\beta_1$ is the **log odds ratio** between having a cat (outcome) as a female living in city A (scenario) and as a female living in city B (another scenario). 

$$logit_1 = \beta_0$$

$$logit_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1$$

log (odds ratio) $$ log(\frac{odds_2}{odds_1})= logit_2 - logit_1  = \beta_1$$

The odds ratio is then $e^{\beta_1}$. 



| Log odds       | Sex = 0 (F)         | sex = 1 (M)                             | Log odds ratio                |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| City = 0 (A)   | $\beta_0$           | $\beta_0 + \beta_2$                     | $\beta_2$                     |
| City = 1 (B)   | $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ | $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$ | $\beta_2 + \beta_3$           |
| Log odds ratio | $\beta_1$           | $\beta_1 + \beta_3$                     | $\beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3$ |

### How about interaction term? 

Similar interpretation can be made using the coefficients of both main effect and interaction effect, and we need to be clear what is the reference scenario. The interaction coefficient $\beta_3$ can be used in the following 3 cases: 

1. compared to being a female in city B (reference), the odds ratio for having a cat (outcome) in city B as a male (comparison) is $e^{(\beta_2 + \beta_3)}$.
2. compared to being  a male in city A (reference), the OR for having a cat in city B as a male (comparison) is $e^{(\beta_1 + \beta_3)}$. 
3. compared to being a female in city A (reference), the OR for having a cat in city B as a male (comparison) is $e^{(\beta_1 + \beta_2 + \beta_3)}$. 

When the interaction coefficient has an opposite sign as to the main coefficients, the interpretation still follows the rule above.
