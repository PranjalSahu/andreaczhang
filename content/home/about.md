# About me 

I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Oslo, Norway. My current work is focused on Electronic Health Records. To be more specific, I want to carry out variable selection task on medical time series and make interpretable predictions. 

A package to carry out this task is under development. 






In my free time I like cooking.
